Softboiled      Normal      10  N/A     N/A     Restores 1/2 of the user's max HP. However, this move fails if the user's current HP is 511 or 255 HP below its value at full health.
Rest            Psychic     10  N/A     N/A     Cures major condition, recovers to full health, and fall asleep. Does not cure status changes caused by major condition.
Transform       Normal      10  N/A     N/A     The user morphs into a near-exact copy of the target. Stats, stat modifiers, type, moves and appearance are changed; the user's level and HP remain the same and each copied move receives only 5 PP.
Metronome       Normal      10  N/A     N/A     The user performs a randomly selected move; almost any move in the game could be picked. Metronome cannot generate itself, Struggle or any move that the user already knows.

Substitute      Normal      10  N/A     N/A     The user takes one-fourth of its maximum HP to create a substitute; this move fails if the user does not have enough HP for this. Until the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by other Pokemon. In-game, the user can still be inflicted with status effects and stat modifiers from other Pokemon, but this is fixed in Pokemon Stadium. If a Substitute breaks from a hit during a multistrike move such as Fury Attack, the user takes damage from the remaining strikes.

# Moves that do a special amount of damage:
# counter (different priority, retaliates damage) - ignore type
# set damage moves (sonicboom, dragonrage) - ignore type

# psywave: random between 1 and 1.5 times user level - ignore type
# halve current hp - ignore type
# auto-ko, doesn't work on faster pokemon -- uses damage formula (does 65535 damage in game)

Counter         Fighting    20  Var     100%    Almost always goes last; if an opponent strikes with a Normal- or Fighting-type attack before the user's turn, the user retaliates for twice the damage it had endured.

Horn-Drill      Normal      5   KO      30%     The target faints; doesn't work on faster or higher-leveled Pokemon.
Bide            Normal      10  Var     100%    The user absorbs all damage for 2-3 turns and then inflicts twice the absorbed damage on its target. This move ignores the target's type but still cannot hit Ghost-type Pokemon.
Mirror-Move     Flying      20  Copy    N/A     The user performs the last move executed by its target; if applicable, an attack's damage is calculated with the user's stats, level and type(s). This moves fails if the target has not yet used a move. Mirror Move also cannot copy itself.
Super-Fang      Normal      10  Var     90%     This move halves the target's current HP.

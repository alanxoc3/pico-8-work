    My only concern is that you can't unfreeze your pokemon

    This is probably the best reference for all the moves:

--------------------------------------------------------------

Main move modifications from pokemon stadium:

    - whirlwind: has later priority & switch random pokemon from opponent.
    - roar:      has later priority & switch random pokemon from opponent.
    - teleport:  has later priority & switch random pokemon from user.
    - swift:     always hits. no accuracy check. hits dig, fly, and pokemon behind substitute.

Other modifications from pokemon stadium:

    - an infinite battle is only possible if both sides keep switching
    - status damage is not taken if a pokemon doesn't get a chance to attack due to roar, whirlwind, teleport, fainting, or switching.
    - frozen stat condition has 10% chance to unthaw
    - pokemon can't receive status conditions from moves of one of their own types or resistances
    - two abras that keep using teleport to switch out will not take poison damage.
    - if opponent keeps using roar, preventing you from attacking (because you use roar/teleport/whirlwind/counter), then you don't take poison damage.

Battle menu has these:

    fight
    switch
    stats          ( shows paralysis burn... )
    opponent stats ( shows paralysis/burn... )
    exit

--------------------------------------------------------------

What actions look like:

    an action has 1 message, and can only affect only 1 pokemon/party
    but it can create a new action that affects the other party

    action has:
        {
            message="its,super,effective",
            logic=function(active, party),
            active=activepkmn, -- p1 or p2
            party=partylist,   -- p1 or p2
            animation_index=go_out|go_in|shake|dig|fly|...
        }

Action is skipped if the active pokemon referenced in it is no longer the active pokemon.
Also, a KO check is run after each action. If passes, a KO action is added.

The function can return a list of actions.

battle starts with 2 actions. p1 (bottom) sends out pkmn as first action. p2 sends out pkmn as second action.

can an action create another action? ex, grass attacks water, could it generate another


action displays message first
    wait .25 sec
then does the animation
    wait .25 sec
then executes the function
    wait .25 sec
then next action

for status moves...
    pikachu use thndrwave
    oddish is paralyzed

hurt by (poison|toxic|burn)

attack look like:
bulbasaur
   use
leechseed

different messages...



for solarbeam, hyperbeam, trapping moves, rage, other multiturn moves, and struggle... there is no move menu when you select fight
when you hover over a disabled move, it will say disabled in the br screen
for metronome

when turn starts, only a few actions are set:
switch 1
switch 2
(determine speed)
move 1
move 2

speed determines status effect application


frozen|paralyzed|sleeping are manifest during move

rest resets toxic counter

--------------------------------------------------------------

Pseudocode for battle logic:

    If the opposing Pokémon is under effect of a multi-turn attack, it doesn’t use an attack.
        Hyper Beam check. If the last move the Pokémon chose for use is Hyper
        Beam, the Pokémon"must recharge" and skips its attack and then Hyper Beam’s
        effect ends. (If the Pokémon also flinches, the "X must recharge!" message
        isn’t shown but Hyper Beam’s effect will still end.)

    turn_init()
        -- priority 0 - n/a - switch
        -- priority 1 - spd - quick attack
        -- priority 2 - spd - main moves
        -- priority 3 - spd - counter, whirlwind, roar, teleport

        -- just figure out who goes first.
        -- speed determines the first one. if both are in the same priority.
        -- if speed is same, a coin is flipped

    turn_update()
        p1 actions
        p2 actions

        switch (use pokemon speed to determine first)
        attack (use pokemon speed to determine first)

    attack(move)
        trapped   check
        sleep     check
        freeze    check
        paralysis check
        flinch    check
        confusion check else damage pokemon

        if none of the above status conditions
            if not a multiturn attack (dig, fly, hyperbeam, solarbeam, rage, thrash)
                lower pp for move

            -- if it aims on a pokemon, it will call the damage function and pass an attacker.

        -- add action here, because the move could have started poison.
        -- two abras that keep using teleport to switch out will not take poison damage.
        -- if you and opponent keep using roar, but opponent is faster than you and both your pokemon have poison damage, you will not take poison damage for as long as opponent uses roar.

Welcome to the world of PICO-8 Pokemon! Picodex is a generation 1 Pokemon battle simulator. The battle mechanics in picodex are mostly based on
those in Pokemon Stadium 1, though some moves and mechanics have been slightly changed for various reasons. The "Movedex" section describes what
each move does. An asterisk (*) next to a move's name indicates that the move in Picodex behaves differently than the same move in Pokemon
Stadium 1.

# Picodex
Picodex is a complete Pokemon generation 1 battle simulator for PICO-8. The entire battle simulator fits within only 32 kilobytes, which is the cartridge size for a PICO-8 game. This directory contains the un-minified code for Picodex.
There were tons of hacky things I had to do to get everything fitting. When I get the time, I'd like to write an article about it.

A few ways to play picodex:
- Lexaloffle BBS: TODO
- Itch.io: TODO
- Run this command in PICO-8: `TODO`

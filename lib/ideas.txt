do I want a package management system in comments?
or do I want the whole function thing?

if package management, then I could have folders.
then you just need comments.
some things are packaged together.

but what about libraries using other functions?
how would that be fixed?

I could have packages in the library files too.

And I may not be using all the functions in a specific library, so I do want to
pull by function.

And what about constants files? just have a function in a comment?

inevitable is that baddies will destroy the planets

first make title screen/level select

idea:
enter level: icon gets smaller and disappears, circle enlarge, player starts in center, 3 2 1 go
exit level:  icon gets bigger, circle smaller, no 3 2 1.
beat level:  all the ships get out of the screen
             ships you rescued end up at the title screen
             if you rescued a ship, it stays rescue when you redo the level

levels have a "ships left" icon.
you also have hearts that span multiple levels.

if you die on a level, it would be cool if the level rewinded to the beginning with the words "rewind"
if the previous you didn't die, move to the top of the screen

the title screen is your time machine.

level select/title is wrapped. levels you can't get to yet are locked (dark grey, question marks)

TITLE
1 2 3 4 5 6...

always lose level: delay so some people can be rescued

leaving 

hearts: ship, rotated 90 degs, only white lines, particle redness? smaller

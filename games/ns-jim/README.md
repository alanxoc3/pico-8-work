Ninja Star Jim.

I came up with this idea in my dream. Jim is at home, then he asks his mom if
he can go outside to play. His mom tells him to go and do something with his
life.

Thus Ninja Star Jim is born! Basically, it is a side scroller with rows like
Plants vs. Zombies.

If you press the button, you shoot a ninja star! If your star hits someone, you
gotta go retrieve it. You only have a few stars. If the star goes off the
screen, you gotta go get it too.

The screen is more narrow than other Pico-8 games. You travel around a
neighborhood, then it slowly changes to other landscapes.

The final boss is a giant dog who has fire breathing powers. You only have
three health. If you die, then your score goes to ZERO, and you have the option
to continue from where you died.

Once you beat the fire breathing dog, Jim feels like he has finally done
something with his life, so he goes home. His mom tells Jim that he was gone
for a while. She tells Jim he can go to his room now. Then, "Jim!!!! What
happened to Spot?".

There has gotta be a picture with jim, spot, and the mom somewhere in the
house. When you leave the house it says: "And thus the hero was born." Then a
cool NINJA STAR JIM logo, similar to the Tower of Alcheus logo.

The original title screen will have a bland looking logo saying NS Jim. That NS
Jim will be on the screen until you leave your house. Then it will turn into a
Ninja Star Jim!!!

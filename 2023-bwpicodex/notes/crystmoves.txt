# Moves that set a temp flag on pokemon (cannot be baton passed). par/brn/etc are not passed. cnf is. mimic sets a temp flag, to prevent mimic from being used again. Hmm... Every Pokemon has an encore and disable timer. If both are set to the same move, that pokemon uses struggle.
Disable      Normal   20 N/A     55%  -- The target cannot choose its last move for 2-5 turns. Disable only works on one move at a time and fails if the target has not yet used a move or if its move has run out of PP. The target does nothing if it is about to use a move that becomes disabled.

(Moves with a recharge turn like Hyper Beam can be generated.)
Metronome    Normal   10 N/A     N/A  -- The user performs a randomly selected move; almost any move in the game could be picked. Metronome cannot generate itself, Sketch, Struggle or any move that the user already knows.

(If Transform is used by Ditto, the effects of Metal Powder stop working after transformation.)
Rage         Normal   20 20      100% -- Separate rage counter up to 255. Increases Rage's attack power if user is damaged by an attack while using Rage.

Fury Cutter  Bug      20 10      95%  -- The base power of this move doubles with each consecutive hit; however, power is capped at a maximum 160 BP and remains there for any subsequent uses. If this move misses, or if the user selects another move, base power will be reset to 10 BP on the next turn.
Defense Curl Normal   40 N/A     N/A  -- Raises the user's Defense by 1 stage; after one use of this move, the user's starting base power is doubled for every use of Rollout.

Toxic        Poison   10 N/A     85%  -- The target is badly poisoned, with the damage caused by poison doubling after each turn. However, Toxic poisoning will revert to normal poisoning if the poisoned Pokemon is switched out.
Substitute   Normal   10 N/A     N/A  -- The user takes one-fourth of its maximum HP to create a substitute; this move fails if the user does not have enough HP for this. Until the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by other Pokemon and shields the user from status effects and stat modifiers caused by other Pokemon. The user is still affected by Sandstorm and Attract from behind its Substitute. If a Substitute breaks from a hit during a multistrike move such as Fury Attack, the user takes damage from the remaining strikes.
Mean Look    Normal   5  N/A     N/A  -- As long as the user remains in battle, the target cannot switch out unless it uses Baton Pass or Teleport. The target will still be trapped if the user switches out by using Baton Pass. Baton Pass can switch actually. Beat up can too.

Foresight    Normal   40 N/A     100% -- Sets a flag on the target, not the user. Until the target faints or switches, the target's Accuracy modifiers and the target's Evasion modifiers are ignored. Ghost-type targets also lose their immunities against Normal-type and Fighting-type moves.

Mist         Ice      30 N/A     N/A  -- Protects the user from negative stat modifiers caused by other Pokemon, but not by itself, until it switches out; can be Baton Passed by user. The user's Accuracy and Evasion stats are also protected. Moves that cause negative stat modifiers as a secondary effect, such as Psychic, still deal their regular damage.
Destiny Bond Ghost    5  N/A     N/A  -- Causes an opponent to faint if its next attack KOs the user.
Endure       Normal   10 N/A     N/A  -- Almost always goes first. The user is left with at least 1 HP following any attacks for one turn, but the move's success rate halves with each consecutive use of Protect, Detect or Endure.
Detect       Fighting 5  N/A     N/A  -- Almost always goes first. The user is protected from all attacks for one turn, but the move's success rate halves with each consecutive use of Protect, Detect or Endure.

Mind Reader  Normal   5  N/A     100% -- Same as lockon. Applies to target in gen ii. This move ensures that the user's next attack will hit against its current target. Even if the user switches out, its replacement's next move will always hit too. Mind Reader fails against Pokemon in the middle of using Protect, Detect, Dig or Fly, as well as Pokemon behind a Substitute.
Perish Song  Normal   5  N/A     N/A  -- All active Pokemon will faint in 3 turns unless they are switched out.

# Moves that set a flag on party (can pass from switch/roar/teleport)
Future Sight Psychic  15 80      90%  -- This move, even if the user and/or the target switch out, will strike the active target at the end of the second turn after its use. This move cannot cause a critical hit and its damage is calculated by using the original user's Special Attack and the original target's Special Defense. The move's damage is typeless so it never receives STAB and ignores weaknesses, resistances and immunities against this move's type. Only one instance of Future Sight may be active at a time; because it occurs at the end of the round, it also hits through Protect, Detect and Endure.

Reflect      Psychic  20 N/A     N/A  -- All Pokemon in the user's party receive 1/2 damage from Physical attacks for 5 turns.

some notes:
- sketch will behave like gen 3. it will copy a move for the duration of the battle, but not after that. So, slightly better than mimic. ditto could learn an extra move like this. by transforming into smeargle.
- sketch otherwise behaves normally and can't copy transform, metronome, or mimic... maybe. gen4 and up allow those moves to be copied.

might have to introduce gender to picodex, to make attract work.
- attract bypasses substitute

chansey -> female
hitmons -> male
nidos -> m/f
kanga -> f
jynx -> f
taur -> m
miltank -> f

these cannot breed: (unrelated)
  legendaries: ARTICUNO ZAPDOS MOLTRES MEWTWO MEW UNOWN RAIKOU ENTEI SUICUNE LUGIA HO-OH CELEBI
  babies: PICHU CLEFFA IGGLYBUFF SMOOCHUM ELEKID MAGBY


these pokemon are "genderless". Attract won't work on them:
  Magnemite Magneton Voltorb Electrode Staryu Starmie Ditto Porygon Articuno Zapdos Moltres Mewtwo Mew Unown Porygon2 Raikou Entei Suicune Lugia Ho-Oh Celebi

unless the pokemon using attract is also genderless. (mew for example.)

I will use PS2 mechanics, which are here: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Stadium_2

Teleport goes last. useful if you want abra to take the damage. And can escape some moves you can't normally escape. And against pursuit.

Move priority.
+4	Pursuit (on a switch)
+3	Switching
+2	Detect, Endure, Protect
+1	ExtremeSpeed, Mach Punch, Quick Attack
 0	All moves not listed
-1	Teleport, Counter, Mirror Coat, Roar, Vital Throw, Whirlwind

Modifications inspired by other games:
DIFF: Gen 1 games. Missingno is a Pokemon and can learn TM05.
DIFF: Gen 1 games. Haze works similarly to how it worked in Gen 1. All effects and stat modifiers that can be Baton Passed can also be reset with haze.
DIFF: Gen 1 games. Substitute works similarly to Gen 1. Only protects from damage done by opponent. Not against any effects.
DIFF: Gen 2 games. Metal powder increases defense and special defense by 50% for ditto even when transformed.
DIFF: Gen 2 games. Recoil, Self-KO, Freeze, and Sleep clauses are all removed.
DIFF: Gen 1 games. Swift will never miss, bypassing all accuracy checks including when opponent uses dig/fly.
DIFF: Protect and Detect protect against Mean Look and Substitute. (Didn't in the original games.)
DIFF: Flail and Reversal can now cause a critical hit and are varied by the random damage factor.
DIFF: Protect and Detect work behind a substitute.
DIFF: Transform fails when opponent is transformed or user is already transformed.
DIFF: Lock-On/MindReader sets a status on the user, not the target. So it can be baton passed and work even if the target switches out. Earthquake/Magnitude/Fissure will still hit a non-flying Pokemon in the middle of Fly.
DIFF: The freeze status condition has a 20% chance to unthaw the Pokemon each turn.
DIFF: Teleport switches the user's Pokemon with another random Pokemon.
DIFF: Transform copies oppenent's gender, species, stats, and moves. Transform does not copy existing stat modifiers.
DIFF: Detect, Protect and Endure all work behind a substitute.
DIFF: Curse is a ghost type move.
DIFF: Being transformed gets the benefit of special items like light ball and thick club.
DIFF: Dynamicpunch always confuses the target if it hits.
DIFF: The Polkadot Bow item is excluded in favor of Pink Bow.

Modifications inspired by design:
DIFF: All Pokemon are set to level 50 with the highest possible stats they can have for that level.
DIFF: When you KO the target with a multihit move such as "Double Slap", your attack will continue onto the next Pokemon sent out.
DIFF: If a Pokemon faints, the next Pokemon in the user's team is sent out automatically. This places more importance on team order.
DIFF: Confusion will be passed with baton pass.
DIFF: A genderless Pokemon that uses Attract will infatuate the foe if the foe is also genderless.
DIFF: Rest will not reset the Toxic counter.
DIFF: Focus band has a chance to activate as long as the Pokemon has >1 HP for anything that does damage. This includes self KO moves, confusion, leech seed, Perish Song, Destiny Bond, etc...
DIFF: Endure protects from all damage for the remainder of the entire turn. Including Perish Song, Future Sight, Pain Split, Spite, Poison, Burn, Sandstorm, Leech Seed...
DIFF: Pain Split hits opponent past substitute.
DIFF: Mean Look and Trapping Moves prevent manual switching. They do not prevent Beat Up, Teleport, or Baton Pass.
DIFF: Self-KO moves, Perish Song, and Destiny Bond all KO the user before the opponent, which means a self-KO will lose the match, unless Endure or Focus Band is activated! Recoil moves will do damage to the user after the attack.
DIFF: Attract's effect passes to the next Pokemon with Baton Pass.
DIFF: The detect/protect/endure counter is Baton Passed.
DIFF: Defense Curl powerup for rollout is Baton Passed.
DIFF: Rage counter is Baton Passed. Rage counter does not reset when rage is not used anymore.
DIFF: Kings Rock has a chance to activate with any attack that does damage at the time of using the attack. It can still be triggered with attacking moves that already has a flinch chance if that flinch chance failed. All multistrike moves only have the chance on the last hit.
DIFF: Baton Pass doesn't allow selecting a Pokemon. Instead, the next available Pokemon in the order of the user's party is selected.
DIFF: Hidden Power has a base power of 60 and changes type to be a random super effective move for one of the opposing Pokemon's 2 types. Defaults to normal type if the chosen type has no super effective weakness.
DIFF: Morning Sun, Moonlight, & Synthesis normally restore 1/2 HP. They restore 3/4 during Sunny Day and 1/4 during rain/sandstorm.
DIFF: Mirror Coat will still activate if the foe used Beatup. It didn't do this in Gen 2.
DIFF: Damage calculation is capped at 999 damage.
DIFF: Amulet Coin doubles base power of Pay Day. (Makes it similar to Drill Peck.)
DIFF: Whirlwind will get rid of spikes from the opponent's side of the field. Roar will not.
DIFF: A Pokemon entering from Baton Pass, Teleport, and Roar will take spike damage.
DIFF: Frustration has 100 Base Power if hp <= foe hp. Otherwise has 50 Base Power.
DIFF: Return has 100 Base Power if hp >= foe hp. Otherwise has 50 Base Power.
DIFF: Swagger still confuses the foe if attack at the max stage.
DIFF: Mimic and Sketch both have 10 pp. The copied move will use the same pp counter as mimic/sketch or whatever move called it.
DIFF: Trigger moves (Mirror Move, Metronome, Sleep Talk) fail when triggering another trigger move. And they cannot trigger Struggle.
DIFF: Mimic & Sketch can copy any move in the game besides struggle.
DIFF: Transform fails if Pokemon is already transformed.
DIFF: Smeargle can only learn Sketch once, not 4 times.
DIFF: Nightmare doesn't go away when awake and will re-apply if the Pokemon falls asleep again.
DIFF: Porygon does not learn the move Conversion 2. (due to the way i pack all moves and to make it so each move is represented when battling)
DIFF: Leftovers fails if the user runs out of PP and doesn't get triggered when pokemon is switched in.
DIFF: Berserk Gene boosts both Special Attack and Attack by 2 stages.

STRAT: Sketch and Mimic allow for the same move to be available in multiple move slots.
STRAT: Hidden Power counters Conversion 2.

IDEA: Unlock moves as you defeat trainers.

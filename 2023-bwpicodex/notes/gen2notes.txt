some notes:
- sketch will behave like gen 3. it will copy a move for the duration of the battle, but not after that. So, slightly better than mimic. ditto could learn an extra move like this. by transforming into smeargle.
- sketch otherwise behaves normally and can't copy transform, metronome, or mimic... maybe. gen4 and up allow those moves to be copied.

might have to introduce gender to picodex, to make attract work.
- attract bypasses substitute

chansey -> female
hitmons -> male
nidos -> m/f
kanga -> f
jynx -> f
taur -> m
miltank -> f

these cannot breed: (unrelated)
  legendaries: ARTICUNO ZAPDOS MOLTRES MEWTWO MEW UNOWN RAIKOU ENTEI SUICUNE LUGIA HO-OH CELEBI
  babies: PICHU CLEFFA IGGLYBUFF SMOOCHUM ELEKID MAGBY


these pokemon are "genderless". Attract won't work on them:
  Magnemite Magneton Voltorb Electrode Staryu Starmie Ditto Porygon Articuno Zapdos Moltres Mewtwo Mew Unown Porygon2 Raikou Entei Suicune Lugia Ho-Oh Celebi

unless the pokemon using attract is also genderless. (mew for example.)

curse is a ??? type move, but maybe it should be a ghost type in this.

for destiny bond, the opponent would faint right after user.

Oooo baton pass will pass all status effects. Not just stat changes, but also other things like substitute. but not transform.

baton pass will pass to the next pokemon in party. if last, then it will wrap to first.

endure is before extreme speed. endure has a counter that halves for how likely it will work each time you use it, protect and some other things.

mirror coat will activate with beatup. (didn't in gen2)

I will use PS2 mechanics, which are here: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Stadium_2
Which is GSC mechanics, but changes a few things slightly.

Teleport goes last. useful if you want abra to take the damage. And can escape some moves you can't normally escape.

BATTLE LOGIC!

turn_init(): # Called immediately after selecting moves
  decide which pokemon goes first:
    7000: pursuit if opponent switched
    6000: switch
    5000: endure, protect, detect
    4000: extreme speed, match punch, quick attack
    3000: normal moves
    2000: vital throw
    1000: counter, mirror coat
    0000: roar, whirlwind

    quick claw will make you have a chance to be 999 within the priority bracket.
    if both priorities are the same, pick a random one between the two

  if p1priority > p2priority: add_action(p1,  n
  p1turn() # or p1switch
  p2turn()

  if self.move in (aero_blast, crab_hammer, cross_chop, karate_chop, razor_leaf, or slash): critical += 2
  if self.item == scope_lens: critical += 1
  if self.transformed_num == chansey   and self.item == lucky_punch: critical += 2
  if self.transformed_num == farfetchd and self.item == stick: critical += 2

calc_accuracy(self, other): # TODO: should mind-reader/lockon end now
  if other.protect/detect: return "fail" # TODO: think about sleep talk with protect
  if self.move == dream_eater and other.sleeping: return 100%

  if other.fly and self.move in (gust, thunder, twister, whirlwind): return 100%
  if other.dig and self.move in (earthquake, fissure, magnitude): return 100%

  if self.move in (swift, vital_throw, faint_attack): return 100%
  if self.move in (thunder) and battle.weather = rain_dance: return 100%

  return calculate_damage_normally() # self.accuracy, other.evasion, move.accuracy. are all a part of this

    -- add action here, because the move could have started poison.
    -- two abras that keep using teleport to switch out will not take poison damage.
    -- if you and opponent keep using roar, but opponent is faster than you and both your pokemon have poison damage, you will not take poison damage for as long as opponent uses roar.

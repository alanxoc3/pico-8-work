------ church interior
god rest you merry gentlemen
let nothing you dismay
for jesus christ our saviour
was born upon this day
to save us all from satan's power
when we were gone astray

o tidings of comfort and joy

------ angel at hill
from god our heavenly father
a blessed angel came
and unto certain shepherds
brought tidings of the same
how that in bethlehem was born
the son of god by name

o tidings of comfort and joy

------ shepherd running
------ shepherds run, you try to catch up, but they are too fast for you.
the shepherds at those tidings
rejoiced much in mind
and left their flocks a-feeding
in tempest, storm and wind
and went to bethlehem straightway
this blessed babe to find

o tidings of comfort and joy

------ arrive at stable
but when to bethlehem they came
whereat this infant lay
they found him in a manger
where oxen feed on hay
his mother mary kneeling
unto the lord did pray

o tidings of comfort and joy

------ wake up to k
now to the lord sing praises
all you within this place
and with true love and brotherhood
each other now embrace
this holy tide of christmas
all other doth deface

o tidings of comfort and joy
comfort and joy
o tidings of comfort and joy

# Pico 8 Library
This repository is my entire Pico-8 workflow.

* `/bin` folder contains scripts.
* `/demos` demos the various libraries.
* `/lib` contains all the library scripts.
* `/template` is the sample project I copy.
* `/work` is miscellanious right now.

* alan-pico-lib
	My library of reusable code.
* demos
	Pico-8 demos/cool things I didn't write.
* games
	Games I am working on.
* sims
	Tools and simulations I'm working on.
	If it ain't a game, it goes here.
* work
	Disjointed work that I randomly create. Sometimes songs are here.

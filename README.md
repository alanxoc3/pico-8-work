# PICO-8 Workspace
For all the pico-eighters out there, this repo contains [@alanxoc3](https://twitter.com/alanxoc3)'s PICO-8 life.

The directory structure is as follows:
* `/TEMPLATE` My build system.
* `/bin` My shell scripts for building pico-8 projects.
* `/.archive` An incomplete collection of cartridge files I made.

To ensure the executable scripts run correctly, set the environment variable `PICO_WORK_DIR` to the root of this repo.

# Pico 8 Library
This repository is my Pico-8 workflow.

* `/bin` folder contains scripts.
* `/demos` demos the various libraries.
* `/lib` contains all the library scripts.
* `/template` is the sample project I copy.
* `/work` is miscellanious right now.

Maybe I'll describe my workflow in writing later. I am still honing it down
though.

Note that the majority of the files in this repo are lua files, but with a .p8
extension. Most of these are not actual Pico-8 cartriges.
